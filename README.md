# Time Difference Calculator

This web page allows you to calculate and sum the differences between pairs of start and end times. Simply enter the time ranges in the provided input area, and the page will display the difference for each range as well as the total sum of all differences.

## Usage

1. Open the web page in a web browser.
2. Enter the time ranges in the following format:
    Each line represents a separate time range, with the start time followed by the end time separated by a space. You can enter as many ranges as needed.
4. As you enter the time ranges, the page will automatically update and display the difference for each range and the total sum of all differences.

## Example

Suppose we have the following time ranges entered:

```
18:45 23:15
17:15 22:35
19:30 23:35
```

The page will display:

```
Start: 18:45, End: 23:15, Diff: 270 minutes
Start: 17:15, End: 22:35, Diff: 320 minutes
Start: 19:30, End: 23:35, Diff: 245 minutes

Sum of all differences: 835 minutes = 13 hours 55 minutes
```
